**Author:** Ali Abbas  
**Course:** Data Visualisation & Visual Analytics  
**Project Type:** Trade Data Analytics & Forecasting  
**Focus Area:** Australia Import–Export Trade (Category 6 & Subcategory 68)  
**Tools Used:** Excel, Tableau  
**Year:** 2025

## Project Summary

This project analyses Australia’s import and export trade patterns from **1988–2024**, focusing on **Category 6 – Manufactured Goods Classified Chiefly by Material** and key subcategories such as **Subcategory 68 (Non-Ferrous Metals)**.

Using Tableau dashboards, analytical storytelling, and forecasting techniques, the project identifies long-term structural trade trends, shifts in industrial demand, and future export projections.

**Business Value:**  
Supports strategic trade planning, industrial policy evaluation, and data-driven decision-making by highlighting historical behaviour, volatility, and future outlook.

---

## Key Objectives

- Analyse long-term import and export trends.
- Identify structural shifts and trade pattern changes.
- Compare Category 6 performance against major subcategories.
- Forecast export performance for Subcategory 68.
- Translate analytics into clear narrative storytelling.
- Present insights through professional data visualisations.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
- **Time Period:** 1988–2024
- **Coverage:** Import & export values (Raw Dollar + Statistical Pattern)
- **Main Category:** Category 6 – Manufactured goods classified chiefly by material
- **Focus Subcategory:** 68 – Non-Ferrous Metals

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation & Transformation

- Combined import and export datasets into unified format.
- Created calculated fields for:
  - Raw dollar analysis
  - Statistical pattern ratios
  - Trend comparisons
- Performed cleaning, validation, and consistency checks.

### 2. Analytical Techniques

- Time-series trend analysis
- Comparative category vs subcategory analysis
- Ratio-based benchmarking
- Forecast estimation for export growth

### 3. Visualization & Storytelling

- Tableau dashboards for exploratory analysis.
- Storyboards for narrative-driven insights.
- Annotation layers highlighting major economic events.

---

## Key Insights

### Historical Trade Behaviour

- Category 6 exports showed resilience despite global disruptions.
- Subcategory 68 maintained steady export demand over decades.
- Import dependency increased for manufactured metal products.

### Structural Shift

- Export ratios declined post-Global Financial Crisis.
- Imports of manufactured metals rose steadily, indicating increased domestic demand.

### Forecast Outlook

- Subcategory 68 exports show stabilization with projected continuation in the **$14,000–$16,000 range**.
- Indicates maturity and reduced volatility compared to earlier growth cycles.

---

## Recommendations

1. Strengthen export infrastructure to support industrial sectors.
2. Diversify trade partnerships to reduce concentration risk.
3. Encourage value-added manufacturing capability.
4. Monitor global commodity cycles for proactive planning.
