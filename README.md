# Australia Import & Export Visual Analytics (1988–2024)

## Project Overview
This project presents a visual analytics study of Australia’s import and export trends over a 36-year period using official Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) trade data. The analysis focuses on identifying long-term structural patterns, trade volatility, and category-level performance, with a deep dive into **Category 6 – Manufactured Goods Classified Chiefly by Materials**.

The project combines Excel-based analytical calculations with Tableau dashboards and visual storytelling to support data-driven economic and policy insights.

## Objectives
- Analyse long-term import and export trends in Australia (1988–2024)
- Identify statistical patterns using trade ratios and proportional contribution
- Examine analytical patterns using year-on-year change
- Evaluate the performance of manufactured goods within Australia’s trade portfolio
- Assess the impact of major global events such as the 2008 GFC and COVID-19
- Communicate insights using dashboards and storyboards

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – Data preparation, transformation, statistical ratios, analytical patterns
- **Tableau** – Dashboards, storyboards, trend analysis, forecasting
- **ABS Trade Data** – Official Australian trade statistics

## Methodology
1. Cleaned and structured import and export datasets spanning 1988–2024
2. Created statistical patterns using ratios relative to total trade
3. Generated analytical patterns using year-on-year percentage change
4. Designed Tableau dashboards to analyse category and sub-category trends
5. Built storyboards to communicate insights and export forecasts

---

## Key Insights
- Australia’s total trade expanded significantly post-2000, driven by mineral and energy exports
- Category 6 exports declined in relative importance after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis
- **Non-ferrous metals (Sub-category 68)** remained resilient and showed strong export growth
- Imports of **manufactured metal goods (Sub-category 69)** increased steadily, highlighting domestic dependency
- COVID-19 caused temporary disruption, but key material exports recovered quickly

---

## Visual Highlights
Key dashboards and storyboards are available in the `/visuals` folder, including:
- Total import vs export trends
- Category 6 trade performance relative to total trade
- Export structure and forecast for Sub-category 68 (Non-ferrous metals)

> Note: Tableau dashboards were used to generate these insights. Interactive Tableau access is not required to interpret the findings.
